## Getting Started

To use the programs in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and compile the C files with a C compiler, such as GCC.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

## Programs Included

### Basic Programs

- **Hello World**: Introduction to basic I/O in C with `printf()`.
- **Personal Details Display**: A program that displays formatted personal information.
- **Swapping Numbers**: Swap two numbers with and without using a temporary variable.

### Arithmetic and Mathematical Calculations

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus).
- **Simple and Compound Interest**: Calculate interest based on user input values.
- **Unit Conversions**: Convert units such as centimeters to meters and kilometers, and Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Conditional Statements

- **Even or Odd**: Determines if a number is even or odd.
- **Maximum and Minimum**: Find the maximum and minimum among two or three numbers.
- **Leap Year Checker**: Checks if a given year is a leap year.
- **Character Type Checker**: Checks if a character is uppercase, lowercase, a digit, or a special symbol.

### Loops

- **For Loop Examples**: Printing numbers, summing digits, etc.
- **While Loop Examples**: Calculating factorials, summing even numbers, and displaying prime numbers up to 100.
- **Do-While Loop Examples**: Programs such as finding the maximum digit in a number, or determining if a number is prime.

### Patterns

- **Number Patterns**: Various number patterns are generated using nested loops. For example:
  ```
  1
  1 2
  1 2 3
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Character Patterns**: Patterns using ASCII characters, e.g., A, B, C.
- **Triangle Patterns**: Generating pyramid-like structures with numbers or characters.

### Advanced Programs

- **Factorial Calculator**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **HCF Finder**: Finds the highest common factor (HCF) of two numbers.
- **Prime Number Checker**: Checks if a given number is prime.
- **Armstrong Number**: Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.
- **Quadratic Equation Solver**: Solves quadratic equations and returns real or complex roots.
- **Temperature and Currency Conversions**: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and conversions between various currency units.
- **Geometric Calculations**: Calculate the area and perimeter of rectangles, circles, and triangles.
  
## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any program:

1. **Navigate** to the directory containing the `.c` file you wish to compile.
2. **Compile** the file with a C compiler, such as `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputfile
   ```
3. **Run** the executable:
   ```bash
   ./outputfile
   ```

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to view and modify the source code.
