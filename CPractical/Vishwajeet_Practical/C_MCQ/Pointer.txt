{

int x,y = 10;

x = y * NULL;

printf("%d",x);

}

a) error

b) 0

a) 8 8

b) 1 8

c) 2 9

d) 1 9

Ans: d

5. What is the output of this program?

7.What will be output if you will compile and execute the following c code?
 

void main(){

int huge*p=(int huge*)0XC0563331;

int huge*q=(int huge*)0xC2551341;

*p=200;

printf("%d",*q); 

}

(a)0

(b)Garbage value

(c)null

(d) 200

(e)Compiler error
	Answer: 200


8.What will be output if you will compile and execute the following c code?
struct marks{

int p:3;

int c:3;

int m:2;

};

void main(){

struct marks s={2,-6,5};

printf("%d %d %d",s.p,s.c,s.m); 

}

(a) 2 -6 5

(b) 2 -6 1

(c) 2 2 1

(d) Compiler error

(e) None of these

Answer: (c)

Explanation:
	s.p: 2 in binary is 010. Since p is a 3-bit bit-field, it takes the least significant 3 bits, resulting in 010, which is 2 in decimal.
s.c: -6 in binary is 11111010. Since c is a 3-bit bit-field, it takes the least significant 3 bits, resulting in 010, which is 2 in decimal due to two's complement representation.
s.m: 5 in binary is 101. Since m is a 2-bit bit-field, it takes the least significant 2 bits, resulting in 01, which is 1 in decimal.
So, the correct output is:
(c) 2 2 1
